Student/Course management system
System scope:
I designed a base system in python that does the following:
-	Defines three classes: AdminUser, Student and Course.
-	The admin user can create, modify and delete course, and submit grades.
-	A student can enroll/un-enroll a course. The student class also has a function that allows the student to delete their details
Areas of improvement:
I did not account for events like:
-	Restricting variables to accept specific inputs
-	Proper authentication
-	Proper use of the while loop 
-	Updating modified variable in database

I hope to keep working on this project and improve the system further as the I learn more in the lecture.
